                    Hello my name is Kshitiz Gupta and I am a Software Engineer. I love developing full fledged web and mobile applications.
                    One thing I have improved over time in me, is not giving up. If I want to achieve a milestone, and I don't know how to do it, I will be honest to myself and dedicate more time to explore and learn. But that's what we do in real life right ?
                    I may be blunt or straight forward, but I am loyal, if I chose you then I will be there for you 24 hours, because that's what I do.
                    Challenges excite me, staying idle frights me!
